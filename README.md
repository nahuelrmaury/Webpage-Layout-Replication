# Webpage Layout Replication

In this task, we aim to replicate the layout of a webpage as closely as possible to the one shown in the "Task.png" image. The primary goal is to recreate the visual design and layout, and functionality of controls (buttons, forms, etc.) will not be implemented.

## Introduction

Replicating the layout of an existing webpage is a common practice for web designers and developers. This task allows us to focus solely on the visual aspects of the webpage, such as the placement of elements, typography, and styling, without implementing any functional logic.

## Layout Replication

1. Start by creating an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) as the foundation of our webpage layout.

2. Use the "Backup Web Page Example" as a starting point. This example provides a basic structure and styles that we can build upon.

3. Carefully examine the "Task.png" image to replicate the placement of elements, such as headers, navigation, content sections, and footer. Pay attention to fonts, colors, and spacing.

4. Replace the content of the example with placeholder content that matches the structure of the reference image. Focus on maintaining the visual layout.

## Testing

Testing in this context means visually comparing the replicated layout (in the web browser) to the reference image ("Task.png"). Ensure that the placement and styling of elements closely resemble the reference.

## Avoiding Horizontal Scroll

To avoid horizontal scrolling, follow these guidelines:

- Use responsive design techniques, such as setting `max-width` for container elements.
- Ensure that images and other content within containers do not exceed their parent's width.
- Test the layout on different screen sizes to verify responsiveness.

## Result

The result of this task will be a webpage layout that closely resembles the reference image ("Task.png"). Remember that the functionality of controls will not be implemented.
